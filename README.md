Description:- API Integration and Data Visualization

In this project, we worked on API Integration and Data Visualization by connecting to an external API to fetch real-time data and represent it graphically.

Tools Used:

Python: Primary programming language for API integration, data processing, and visualization.

Requests Library: To send HTTP requests and retrieve data from the API.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing the fetched data in the form of graphs and charts.

JSON Library: For parsing the JSON response from the API.

API Used:

OpenWeather API: Used to fetch real-time weather data (like temperature, humidity, etc.) based on city names and coordinates.

Platform Used:

Developed and executed on the Python IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment).

Editor Used:

IDLE (Pythonâ€™s default editor and IDE) was used for writing and running the Python scripts.

Where This Task Can Be Used:

Weather Monitoring Applications

Dashboards for Climate Analysis

Real-Time Data Monitoring Systems

Educational Projects for Learning API Consumption and Visualization

Smart City Weather Reporting Tools
